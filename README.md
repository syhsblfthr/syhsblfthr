# Hello, World!
I am someone who is very interested in stuff related to computers. I sometimes make random stuff in my spare time and I like to just publish them here, I also like to publish my "real" projects or projects that I made for a "reason" (competition, school, etc.) on my GitHub. May someone find any of them useful.
